OOPS concepts to be used in drupal 8 development:

1: Namespaces: Namespaces give a small space to php classes inside a file. This takes care of problem that no two classes can have same name, also saves memory
2. Use statement: Its used to import a particular class inside your current working file, it helps as with class all the functions/objects are also imported
3. class can be aliased in PHP,
4. Dependency Injection: This concept helps us to remove hardcoded dependencies/ change the dependencies during runtime 
    DI, concept is helpful when creating and using services. services are inside--> service container.
